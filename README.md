# Not Worms!
This game is a bad fake of Worms Armageddon. It's a 2 player based game where the goal is to kill the enemy player.
As a library I have used [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
Link to the repository can be found at my GitHub profile: https://github.com/Vin1X/Worms

## How it works
The game begins with player 1. You can move to the left or right. Aim at your target and shoot. After each shot the next player has his turn. First player has won if the enemy is dead (health = 0)

## Controls:
- Move: "A" / "D" or Left Arrow / Right Arrow
- Shoot: Left Mouse Button
- Pause: "P"
- Quit Game: "ESC"

## How to run the game
The game is Windows only and can only be build in a Windows operatin gsystem. Windows 10/11 are preffered since I don't know if lower version also work.

### Using executable file
There is an prebuild .exe file which you can open.

### Build it on your own
I used a vscode template from [Educ8s](https://github.com/educ8s/Raylib-CPP-Starter-Template-for-VSCODE-V2) which uses a Makefile to build the project. So you have to open the "main.code-workspace" file to open up vscode and then hit "F5" to build and run the game.

#### Install the library
I've also followed an [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaAcVk5jUd8) on how to install and use Raylib in VSCode
